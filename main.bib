abstract="The NII Testbeds and Community for Information access Research (ntcir) has been the first benchmarking campaign that created a test collection specifically for patent retrieval, in 2001/2002. Over the course of just over a decade, organisers and participants at NTCIR patent-related challenges have addressed the problem of mono- and multilingual patent search and automated translation. In doing so, the only available East Asian language patent test collections have been created and made publicly available for research purposes. This chapter provides a reference summary of the efforts undertaken in NTCIR, helping the reader understand the challenges addressed, the datasets created and the solutions observed.",

abstract = {We report on extensive experiments using rule-based induction methods for document classification. The goal is to automatically discover patterns in document classifications, potentially surpassing humans who currently read and classify these documents. By using a decision rule model, we induce results in a form compatible with expensive human engineered systems that have recently demonstrated excellent performance. Using computer-intensive rule induction methods, we have conducted experiments over a vast set of document families, including UPI, Reuters, NTIS, and the Library of Congress Catalog. We report on several approaches to classic problems for such applications, including choosing the right representation for text, and handling high dimensionality.},
